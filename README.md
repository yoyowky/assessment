# assessment-frontend

The following is a skeleton structure for the QUANDl frontend assessment.

## Task

Your goal is to reproduce the following mockup for two functional web pages given the current mockup found here:

https://invis.io/NQEVR3K5T

* Please fork this application as part of your solution.
* Create all HTML/CSS/JS to match that closely matches the mockup
* Add in the dynamic functionality from the mockups between the two pages
* Tables should be scrollable and smooth
* Website should function on IE11+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari

Other things to note:

* You can build off the skeleton application. It has the sample data and some examples of how to display it.
* You will need to learn a little about how ember works, see the further reading links below
* Fonts to be used in the design:
  * https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quantico
  * https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro
* All buttons/links should write out a message to the console indicating they have been clicked. (unless another action is defined in the mockup)
* Feel free to use CSS libraries like SASS or LESS if that's easier (SASS has been installed and enabled by default)
